The data attached is associated with Figure 1H-K from the 2022 iScience paper. It contains 1s of data (in 100ms bins = 10 bins/response). Data are as follows:
	Col 1 = BeeID - animal identifier;
	Col2 = sensillum – we recorded from up to 6 sensilla (i.e., “taste buds”) per animal. “s1” has the same physical location on each animal.
	Col3 = sugar – this is the stimulus type
	Col4 = concentration – the concentration of the sugar used, where “0mM” is water.
	GRN = gustatory response neuron, this is the neuron identifier within each sensillum. GRN1 has the highest firing rate almost always – it is the main spiking neuron; GRN2 is the “bursting rate”, essentially, because GRN2 spikes only occur at the end of bursts of spikes. GRN1 is basically absent always, except in responses to fructose (“fruc”) where it is present at low rates (~5 spikes/s)
